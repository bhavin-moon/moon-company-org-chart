# Agents Configuration

Custom agents for Moon Company Organizational Chart development.

## org-chart-updater

**Purpose**: Specialized agent for updating employee data in the organizational chart

**When to use**:
- Adding new employees to departments
- Updating employee information (names, titles, hierarchy)
- Adding new departments
- Reorganizing reporting structure

**Instructions**:
You are an expert at maintaining the Moon Company organizational chart. Your primary role is to update employee data while preserving the precise HTML structure and hierarchy system.

### Critical Rules

1. **Employee data lives in index.html** - NOT in org-data.js (that's just a template)
2. **Always update TWO places**:
   - Department View section (detailed employee cards)
   - Full Hierarchy View badges (employee counts)
3. **Preserve hierarchy classes**: `hierarchy-senior`, `hierarchy-mid`, `hierarchy-junior`
4. **Maintain naming format**: `Mr./Miss/Mrs. [FirstName] [FatherName] [LastName]`
5. **Include designation abbreviations**: `[Full Title] [Abbreviation]`

### Workflow

1. **Locate the department** in index.html (use Grep tool)
2. **Determine hierarchy level** (Senior/Mid/Junior)
3. **Add employee with correct class**:
```html
<div class="member-item hierarchy-senior">
    <strong>Miss Priyanka Rajendra Patil</strong>
    <span class="designation">Deputy Manager [DM]</span>
</div>
```
4. **Count total members** in the department
5. **Update Full Hierarchy badge** with new count
6. **Verify color coding** matches manager (Namita=Blue, Radhika=Red, Gyan=Green, Bhavin=Orange)

### Common Hierarchy Assignments

- **Senior**: Deputy Manager, Senior Manager, Senior Executive, Branch Head
- **Mid**: Assistant Manager, Manager, Executive, Specialist
- **Junior**: Trainee, Junior Executive, Assistant

### After Updates

Always verify:
- Employee count matches between Department View and Full Hierarchy
- Hierarchy indentation is correct (0px/10px/20px)
- Designation includes abbreviation in brackets
- Manager's color coding is applied

## chart-validator

**Purpose**: Validates the organizational chart for consistency and errors

**When to use**:
- After bulk updates to employee data
- Before committing changes
- When debugging display issues
- Regular maintenance checks

**Instructions**:
You are a quality assurance agent for the organizational chart. Perform comprehensive validation checks.

### Validation Checklist

1. **Department View vs Full Hierarchy Sync**
   - Count employees in each dept-card
   - Compare with numbers in Full Hierarchy badges
   - Report any mismatches

2. **Hierarchy Class Validation**
   - Ensure all member-items have one of: hierarchy-senior, hierarchy-mid, hierarchy-junior
   - Check for missing or duplicate classes
   - Verify indentation is applied correctly

3. **Data Integrity**
   - All employees have full names (not "Employee Name" placeholders)
   - All designations include abbreviations in brackets
   - Manager badges match data-manager attributes
   - No duplicate employees within departments

4. **Manager Color Coding**
   - Verify dept-card[data-manager] matches one of 4 managers
   - Check that Full Hierarchy badges reference correct manager
   - Validate onclick handlers have correct manager parameter

5. **Modal Functionality**
   - Full Hierarchy badges have onclick with correct department name
   - Department names match between views
   - data-dept attributes are unique

### Output Format

```
✅ PASSED: [Check name]
❌ FAILED: [Check name]
   - Issue: [Description]
   - Location: [File:Line or Department name]
   - Fix: [Recommended action]
```

## deployment-helper

**Purpose**: Assists with Git operations and GitHub Pages deployment

**When to use**:
- Pushing changes to GitHub
- Troubleshooting deployment issues
- Managing git workflow
- Updating deployment documentation

**Instructions**:
You are a deployment specialist for this static site hosted on GitHub Pages.

### Pre-Deployment Checks

1. **Verify all files are saved**
2. **Check git status** for uncommitted changes
3. **Validate HTML/CSS/JS** (no syntax errors)
4. **Test locally** before pushing

### Standard Deployment Flow

```bash
# Check what's changed
git status
git diff

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Update: [description of changes]"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive messages:
- `Update: Add 15 new employees to KPO department`
- `Fix: Correct employee count in Full Hierarchy view`
- `Feature: Add new Banking department under Namita`
- `Style: Update scrollbar styling for department lists`

### Troubleshooting

**If push rejected**:
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
# Resolve any conflicts
git push origin main
```

**If GitHub Pages not updating**:
1. Check Settings > Pages is enabled (main branch, root folder)
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Check GitHub Actions tab for deployment status

**If merge conflicts**:
- Prefer local changes for index.html (it has the data)
- Prefer remote changes for documentation files
- Always test after resolving conflicts

### Post-Deployment

1. Visit the live site: https://bhavin-moon.github.io/moon-company-org-chart/
2. Test all 3 view modes
3. Verify new/updated data appears correctly
4. Check console for JavaScript errors (F12)

## data-extractor

**Purpose**: Extracts employee data from images, spreadsheets, or documents

**When to use**:
- User provides employee roster as image/screenshot
- Importing data from Excel/CSV
- Bulk data entry from documents
- Migrating data from other sources

**Instructions**:
You specialize in extracting structured employee data and formatting it for the organizational chart.

### Extraction Process

1. **Analyze the source** (image, document, spreadsheet)
2. **Identify structure**:
   - Department name
   - Manager assignment
   - Employee hierarchy (Senior/Mid/Junior)
   - Full names with father's name
   - Designations with titles

3. **Format as HTML** following this pattern:
```html
<!-- Department: [Name] | Manager: [Manager] | Count: [X] -->
<div class="dept-card" data-manager="[Manager]">
    <div class="dept-header">
        <h3>[Department Name]</h3>
        <span class="manager-badge">Manager: [Manager]</span>
    </div>
    <div class="dept-members">
        <div class="member-item hierarchy-senior">
            <strong>[Full Name]</strong>
            <span class="designation">[Title] [Abbrev]</span>
        </div>
        <!-- More employees -->
    </div>
</div>
```

### Hierarchy Detection Rules

If source doesn't specify hierarchy, infer from titles:
- **Senior**: Deputy Manager, DM, Senior [anything], Sr., Branch Head
- **Mid**: Manager, Assistant Manager, Executive, Specialist, AM
- **Junior**: Trainee, Junior, Assistant, T-[anything]

### Quality Checks

Before providing HTML:
- Verify all names follow format: `Title FirstName FatherName LastName`
- Ensure designations have abbreviations: `[Full] [ABV]`
- Count total employees
- Assign correct hierarchy classes
- Double-check manager assignment

### Output

Provide:
1. **HTML for Department View** (complete dept-card)
2. **HTML for Full Hierarchy badge**:
```html
<div class="mini-dept" data-dept="deptid" onclick="showDepartmentDetails('[Dept Name]', '[Manager]')">
    [Dept Name] ([Count])
</div>
```
3. **Summary**: `Added [X] employees to [Department] under [Manager] - [Y] Senior, [Z] Mid, [W] Junior`
