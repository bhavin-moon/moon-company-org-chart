## WORKLOAD IMBALANCE - STRATEGIC CONCERN

### Current Situation
**Namita carries 64.3% of organizational load**

```
Namita:    182 employees
├─ KPO:     94 (51.6% of her workload - CRITICAL CONCENTRATION)
├─ DSPF:    42 (23.1%)
└─ Rest:    46 (25.3% across 10 departments)

vs.

Bhavin:    20 employees (10x less than Namita)
├─ Software: 17 (85% of his workload)
└─ Rest:     3 (15% across 2 departments)
```

### Business Impact
- Single point of failure in KPO department (94 people)
- Potential bottleneck for organizational growth
- Unbalanced team management across 4 senior managers
- May impact employee development and retention

### Strategic Recommendation
Consider organizational restructuring to:
1. Split KPO into 2-3 sub-departments
2. Redistribute to Bhavin or create new senior manager role
3. Balance workload to 30-50 employees per manager
4. Improve management capacity and employee development
