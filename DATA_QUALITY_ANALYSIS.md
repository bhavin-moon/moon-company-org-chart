   - Line 1476: "Mr. Akshay Kishanla Rathi" with "General Manager" title marked hierarchy-mid - should likely be hierarchy-senior

## SECTION 8: SPECIFIC ANOMALIES INVESTIGATION

### Line 137-138: Duplicate "Manager Mishra"

**Finding**: Two identical entries without hierarchy classification
```html
Line 137: <div class="member-item">Manager Mishra</div>
Line 138: <div class="member-item">Manager Mishra</div>
```

**Analysis**:
- Same exact text repeated twice
- No hierarchy class (missing)
- No designation information
- No structure matching format standard
- Suggests data entry error or placeholder never updated

**Hypothesis**: This may be:
1. A duplicate entry - one should be deleted
2. Two different people with same name - needs full name info
3. Placeholder that wasn't populated with real data

**Required Action**: Clarification needed - confirm if one Manager Mishra or two different people

---

### Line 148: Banking Department "Vaishali"

**Finding**: Single-word entry without full naming convention
```html
Line 148: <div class="member-item">Vaishali</div>
```

**Analysis**:
- First name only provided
- No title prefix
- No father's name
- No designation span
- Department badge in Full Hierarchy shows no count (no onclick handler)

**Expected Format**: `Mr./Miss/Mrs. Vaishali [FatherName] [LastName]` with hierarchy class and designation

**Note**: Line 159 contains another Vaishali: "Mr. Vaishali Shrikant Kapure" in Accounts department - possibly same person listed in two departments?

---

### Line 159: "Mr. Vaishali" Gender Anomaly

**Finding**: Gender prefix inconsistency
```html
Line 159: <strong>Mr. Vaishali Shrikant Kapure</strong>
```

**Analysis**:
- "Vaishali" is traditionally a feminine name in Indian naming conventions
- Prefixed with "Mr." (masculine)
- Possible explanations:
  1. Data entry error (should be "Miss" or "Mrs.")
  2. Transgender individual (acceptable but unusual in org chart)
  3. Unique male name not recognized as such
  4. Mistake in source data transcription

**Recommendation**: Verify with HR - request clarification on employee's gender to correct prefix

---

### Lines 148, 487, 1055, 1155, 1182, 1385, 1395, 1517: Placeholder/Incomplete Entries

**Pattern Identified**: "Team Members" appears in 6 locations:
```html
Line 1055: <div class="member-item">Team Members</div>  <!-- ROC -->
Line 1155: <div class="member-item">Team Members</div>  <!-- Quotation -->
Line 1182: <div class="member-item">Team Members</div>  <!-- Cultural -->
Line 1385: <div class="member-item">Team Members</div>  <!-- Exit -->
Line 1395: <div class="member-item">Team Members</div>  <!-- Monitoring -->
Line 1517: <div class="member-item">Team Members</div>  <!-- IT Hardware -->
```

**Status**: All are placeholder entries awaiting data population

---

### Line 487: Accounts Receivable Single Entry

**Finding**: Department with 1 employee in non-standard format
```html
Line 487: <div class="member-item">Pradnya Shelar</div>
```

**Analysis**:
- Only employee listed: "Pradnya Shelar"
- Missing title prefix (Mr./Miss/Mrs.)
- Missing father's name (just given name + surname)
- No hierarchy class
- No designation span
- Department shows "AR" in Full Hierarchy with no onclick (no count shown)

**Comparison with Line 171**:
- Line 171 contains: "Miss Pradnya Gautam Shelar" in Accounts department
- Same surname "Shelar"
- Similar first name (Pradnya vs. Pradnya)
- Possibly same person with incomplete entry in Accounts Receivable

**Question**: Is this the same Pradnya Shelar listed twice? Or different person?

---

4. Rebalance workload distribution between managers (especially Namita's excessive load)

### Quality Assurance
1. Implement pre-commit checks for:
   - Required naming format
   - Hierarchy class presence
   - Designation format compliance
   - Department count synchronization

2. Create data entry checklist:
   - Full name with title and father's name

   - Consistent formatting

3. Regular audits:
   - Monthly data integrity review
   - Quarterly employee count verification

## CONCLUSION

The Moon Company organizational chart maintains good overall data integrity with 96.5% compliance rate for naming conventions and 100% HTML structure validity. However, 6 critical issues (placeholder entries and duplicate data) require immediate attention. The most significant concern is the workload imbalance with Namita managing 64.3% of the organization, primarily due to the large KPO department (94 employees).

**Overall Data Quality Score: 74/100 (Fair - Improvement Required)**

The chart is functional for viewing, but several data quality gaps should be addressed to ensure accurate organizational representation and enable all interactive features to work correctly.
